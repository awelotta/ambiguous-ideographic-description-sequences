# Unihan

x-axis: meaning
y-axis: major shape differences (e.g. simplified vs. traditional)
z-axis: minor typographical differences (e.g. double-storey vs. single-storey g; stylistic differences between countries)

Unicode intends to encode x/y-variants; this is what Unicode (mostly) does with the other symbols, 
and language-markup should deal with z-variants. 

reasons for z-variants in Unicode
- to support **round-trip** compatibility. (This also motivates some duplicates, if some earlier encoding had duplicates.)
- others? support for low-memory devices?
- sometimes "z-variants" are considered significant in some contexts but not others. for example,
	- in Japan, place names tend to be conservative. UnicodeÂ® Technical Standard #37, says to use variant selectors, which are special characters in Unicode

in reality, they made several (how many?) mistakes

unicode also has a bunch of metadata for each character. like what its variants are
